# GLM-5.2 Speed Night — Findings (2026-07-09)

**Question:** is GLM-5.2 decode on 4× DGX Spark at its physics limit (28.8 tok/s), or is there attackable overhead?
**Answer: NOT physics. 63% of every decode step is attackable overhead.** But most of it is unreachable with config flags — collecting it requires custom communication engineering.

---

## The headline measurement: step-time decomposition (k=0 test)

Running with speculation OFF makes tok/s = engine steps/sec directly:

| | value |
|---|---|
| k=0 single-stream | 14.9 tok/s → **67ms per raw engine step** |
| physics floor (weights @ 273GB/s, ~6GB/node/step) | **~25ms (37%)** |
| **overhead (NCCL latency, kernel launch, sync)** | **~42ms (63%)** |

Second finding from the same test: **MTP speculation is doing 2× of the work** (14.9 → ~29 tok/s). And comparing step times k=4 vs k=0 shows each drafter pass costs ~14ms — vs ~2ms of actual compute — so **even the drafter is overhead-bound.** Any per-step overhead reduction compounds across target + 4 draft passes.

**Ceiling math:** overhead fully eliminated → k=4 ≈ 50 tok/s theoretical. Realistic partial win → mid-30s.

## Experiment results (all vs baseline 26.5–31.1 c1 / 60.8 c6, k=4, 512-tok temp-0 prose)

| config | c1 | c6 agg | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (k=4, FLASHMLA 200K) | 26.5–31.1 | 60.8 | reference |
| k=0 (no spec) | 14.9 | 41.8 | decomposition probe — not a serving config |
| NCCL_PROTO=LL | 26.3–28.5 | 61.9 | **neutral** — NCCL already auto-selects LL for small messages |
| **fuse_gemm_comms** | 28.4–29.7 | **63.0** | **small real win on aggregate (+2 c6); c1 within noise. KEPT — it's free** |
| expert-parallel | — | — | **FLEET-KILLER: OOM'd all 4 nodes into swap-death; required physical power-cycle.** EP's MoE layout blows the <1GB-free memory budget. Do not retry without full memory retune (lower gmu, smaller KV). |
| k=5 | not run | — | skipped after the EP incident; theory says marginal (position-5 acceptance ~0.45 vs +1 draft pass/step). Optional future cycle. |

**Shipped config after the night: k=4 + fuse_gemm_comms** (`~/glm-5.2-gb10/speednight-fuse.sh`).

## The RDMA-allreduce verdict (the strategic question)

**BUILD-WORTHY — the data now justifies it.** Reasoning:
- The 42ms/step overhead is real and measured, not hypothesized.
- Config-level attacks are exhausted: NCCL flags neutral (auto-tuned already), fuse pass collects only ~1–2ms, EP structurally infeasible on this memory budget.
- The remaining overhead lives in per-call NCCL/RoCE latency across ~156 tiny allreduces per step. lukealonso's b12x proved the same attack works on PCIe (single-box); nobody has built the RoCE-fabric equivalent for Spark clusters.
- Prize: 5–10 tok/s single-stream (28.8 → mid-30s), compounding through the drafter. It would be the defining community contribution for every multi-Spark owner.
- Cost: weeks-class kernel/verbs engineering. Next step if pursued: profile with torch-profiler to get exact per-allreduce latency, then prototype a one-shot RC-verbs allreduce for the 24KB decode message size.

## Operational lessons
- **EP incident:** untested memory-layout flags on nodes running <1GB free can swap-wedge the entire fleet beyond SSH recovery. Rule: any experiment that changes weight/KV layout gets a reduced gmu first boot. (Cost: one fleet power-cycle, no data loss.)
- Staged monitors with 2.5-min pings (Tony's cadence preference) worked well — kept visibility through every cycle including the outage.

## Scoreboard vs community (for context)
Our 28.8–31 median remains the fastest known sustained single-stream for this stack on 4 nodes; Zatz 640K: 19.6–25.7 (peaks 33–37); Cosmic DCP2 328K: 20–36. Everyone's k=4 now. The differences between rigs are measurement-basis (prose vs synthetic) more than config.

# Speed-Night 2 (2026-07-17)

Baseline going in (same-day bench, warm): c1 31.1 code / 34.2 math; c6 aggregate ~60.5.

## Results by lever (each its own relaunch; 512-tok completions, temp 0, warm)

| Config | c1 code | c1 math | c1 prose | c1 mean | c6 agg (2 rounds) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KNOWNGOOD (k=4, 8192 chunks) | 31.1 | 34.2 | ~27.5 | ~31 | ~60.5 |
| P1: +capture-sizes[5..30] +atomic-add +4096 chunks | 30.8 | 32.9 | 27.5 | 30.4 | **66.2 / 75.0** |
| P2: k=5 +capture[6..36] +atomic-add, 8192 chunks | **32.0** | **36.0** | **29.6** | **32.5** | 64.9 / 71.2 |

## Verdicts

- **cudagraph_capture_sizes incl. the c6 batch size (30 or 36): KEEP — the single biggest c6 win (+10-24% aggregate).** Root cause: default capture sizes round to multiples of (k+1) and skipped c6's token count entirely, so c6 decode ran piecewise (no full graph). Check `max_cudagraph_capture_size` vs `max_num_seqs*(k+1)` on any config change.
- **MTP k=5: KEEP — new c1 records across all three workloads (mean 32.5, math 36.0).** Per-position acceptance at pos-5 measured 0.547 on prose-like loads — above the ~0.51 break-even. Mixed/agentic windows drop to ~0.36 accept at pos-4/5, so k=5 is workload-sensitive; prose/code/math all won.
- **--max-num-batched-tokens 4096: REVERT — cost ~1-2 tok/s c1**, and did NOT fix the short-prompt-behind-long-ingest wait (35.0s vs 33.8s baseline). The real fix (`--max-num-partial-prefills 2`) is **NotImplementedError on this vLLM pin** — re-test after any re-pin.
- **VLLM_MARLIN_USE_ATOMIC_ADD=1: kept** (log-recommended; not isolated, rode along with both winners).
- **GDR finding:** NCCL reports `GPU Direct RDMA Disabled` on all HCAs — `dlvsym(mlx5dv_reg_dmabuf_mr, MLX5_1.25)` fails against Ubuntu rdma-core 50.0 (host and container identical). All cross-node traffic host-stages. On unified-memory GB10 the copy is same-silicon so the penalty is muted; revisit only if chasing the last few tok/s (needs a rdma-core rebuild or NCCL that probes unversioned symbols).
- **Felt latency:** see README — `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` takes first visible token from 7-10s to 0.36s. Biggest perceived-speed lever on the whole stack.
- **NCCL_ALGO=Tree: DEAD — boot fails with `DistBackendError: NCCL error ... invalid usage` (NCCL 2.30.4) at graph capture.** Do not retry on this stack.
- **Dual-rail RoCE: untested tonight** (deliberately skipped after the Tree failure — second rail is verified UP on all 4 nodes; a future candidate, expected 0-2 c1).

## Final serving config (end of night)

`speednight-k5.sh` = KNOWNGOOD + `cudagraph_capture_sizes [6,12,18,24,30,36]` + MTP `k=5` +
`VLLM_MARLIN_USE_ATOMIC_ADD=1` (chunks 8192, NCCL WARN). **c1 mean 32.5 (records on all three
workloads), c6 aggregate 65-71 vs ~60.5 baseline.**

## Ranked: what to do next

1. **DFlash single-pass drafter lane** — the ceiling math says ~48ms of every ~110ms step is the
   k sequential drafter passes (piecewise-only by code). DFlash collapses them to one pass:
   **est. +10-20 c1, the 34→50 path.** Days of work; a `speednight-dflash.sh` lane already exists.
2. **FlashInfer 0.6.14 sparse-MLA port** — jasl's vLLM #41834 posted 41.9 tok/s decode / 1757 tok/s
   prefill on 2× GB10 (DSA-family model) with it. Could replace the slower parts of the b12x
   Triton overlay AND is the only known prefill-rate lever (~800 → potentially 1500+ tok/s).
3. **Remaining cherry-picks onto the pin**: vLLM #47448 (MTP post-final-norm fix — may lift
   acceptance further, compounding with k=5), #47410 (FP32 gate). #46862 already deployed.
4. **Dual-rail RoCE test** (cheap, one relaunch, do it next quiet window).
5. **RDMA one-shot allreduce** — still build-worthy (+5-10) but weeks; do after 1-2.
6. Re-pin to v0.25.1 only when #45317 (native sm_121 DSA) merges or the DFlash/dspark plumbing
   is needed; revalidation protocol is in "Upgrading beyond the pin".

**Post-script:** the end-of-night re-verify of the final k=5 boot read c1 ~22 — because six live
user streams were on the endpoint during the bench (num_requests_running=6; the box was serving
~52 tok/s aggregate to real traffic at that moment). Solo numbers for this exact config stand from
the identical quiet-box boot the same morning (c1 32.5 mean / c6 65-75). Benchmark discipline rule
worth keeping: `curl /metrics | grep num_requests_running` must read 0, or your c1 number is
actually a cN number.

# Speed-Night 3 (2026-07-18) — every remaining lever tested; k5 holds

Same-session KNOWNGOOD baseline (fresh k5 boot, quiet box, verified `num_requests_running=0`):
**c1 31.4 (code 31.0 / math 35.5 / prose 27.7), c6 aggregate 69.7–71.2, MTP accept_len 4.28.**
(Every candidate below is measured against THIS number, not a cross-session one.)

## Phase A — cheap sweeps: 0 wins. k5 is already at the cheap-lever optimum.

| Lever | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Adaptive-k** (`num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size [[1,2,5],[3,6,2]]`) | c1 ~22 (clean), c6 ~58; mechanism confirmed (draft depth drops to k=2 under load) | **regression** — discard |
| **Dual-rail RoCE** (`NCCL_IB_HCA=rocep1s0f0,roceP2p1s0f0`, chan 8) | c1 30.7, c6 66–67; rail-2 tx delta ~27 KB (NCCL never used it) | **no-op** — link-local addressing didn't attract a second NCCL rail; discard |
| **local-argmax drafter** (`use_local_argmax_reduction`, `deepseek_mtp.get_top_tokens` port) | c1 28.9, c6 69 | **slight regression** — the local-argmax path costs more than the vocab-allgather it saves on this stack; discard |
| **TTFT-under-load wart** (33.8 s) | `--max-num-partial-prefills` → `NotImplementedError: Concurrent Partial Prefill` | **pin-blocked** — not supported at ab666069 |
| **Cherry-pick #47448** (GLM MTP post-final-norm) | our `deepseek_mtp.py` already returns `(pre-norm, post-norm)` and norms once in `compute_logits` ("matches SGLang deepseek_nextn") | **already present** in the fork — no-op |
| **Cherry-pick #47410** (GLM-5.2 fp32 gate) | correctness (not speed); config already sets `moe_router_dtype: float32` | **already effective / non-speed** — skip |

## Phase B — DFlash: booted coherent, but the draft doesn't transfer.

Tested [Keys/drowzeys' DFlash draft](https://github.com/drowzeys/keys-latest-GLM-5.2-Quantrio-INT4-INT8-Mixed-Abliterated-DFlash-4x-DGX-Sparks) (Part B, 7 GiB) paired with **our** target, his locked config (128k / k=12 / seqs=4 / KV 10 GiB). Our vLLM image already ships `v1/spec_decode/dflash.py`, so it ran clean.

| Task | DFlash (our target) | Keys (his abliterated target) | our k5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| count | 30.4 | **41.85** | ~32 |
| code | 20.7 | — | 31.0 |
| essay | 19.1 | 11.25 | ~28 |
| reading | 18.9 | 10.08 | ~28 |

**accept_len 2.86, draft-accept 14–15%** (792 tokens drafted / ~120 accepted). Root cause: **his DFlash draft was trained against his *abliterated* target; against our non-abliterated QuantTrio it mispredicts**, so the 12 draft passes per step are mostly wasted and actively slow decode. Also drops context to 128k. **DFlash drafts are target-specific and do not cross the abliteration boundary.** Even with his matched 378 GiB target, DFlash is a *count-only* win (his own numbers show it loses to MTP on essay/reading). **Rejected for our target.**

## Phase C — FlashInfer 0.6.14 sparse-MLA: not a one-night change.

The prefill/decode lever (jasl's vLLM #41834: 41.9 decode / 1757 prefill on 2× GB10 credits FlashInfer 0.6.14's sparse-MLA path) requires either a re-pin to vLLM v0.25.1 + re-port of the entire b12x kernel overlay, or a native sm_121 FlashInfer rebuild. Both are multi-day rebuilds with real revalidation risk. **Documented as roadmap, not attempted** (guardrail: end the night serving ≥ KNOWNGOOD).

## Bottom line

**k5 remains champion: 36 peak / 32.5 mean c1, 65–75 c6, 200k ctx.** Speed-Night 2's wins (c6 cudagraph fix + k=5) were the real cheap gains on this stack; Speed-Night 3 confirms the cheap-lever well is dry. **All remaining upside is multi-day**, ranked:

1. **Self-distilled DFlash draft against OUR QuantTrio target** — the only path to the 40+ count-lane numbers; needs draft training/distillation (the transfer failure above proves a matched draft is mandatory). Best as a *second, fast-lane endpoint*, not a k5 replacement (DFlash loses on prose even when matched).
2. **FlashInfer 0.6.14 native sm_121 build + b12x re-port** — the only prefill-rate lever (~800 → potentially ~1500 tok/s) and a decode candidate.
3. **Re-pin to vLLM v0.25.1** — picks up upstream GLM fixes; heavy revalidation.
4. **RDMA one-shot allreduce** — +5–10 tok/s, weeks.

Dead/confirmed-not-worth on this stack: adaptive-k, dual-rail, local-argmax, EP (fleet-killer), fuse_gemm_comms (symm-mem single-box-only), NCCL Tree (boot-fails), partial-prefills (pin-unsupported).

## Phase B addendum — DFlash at OUR production config (200k + fp8_ds_mla): OOMs.

Re-ran DFlash with our full config (200k, fp8_ds_mla target KV, gmu 0.91, KV 10.95 GiB, capture
sizes [13,26,39,52,65,78]) — not Keys' 128k. **Result: crashes at KV-cache init:**
```
ValueError: max seq len 200000 needs 13.86 GiB KV, only 10.2 GiB available.
Estimated max model length = 147,136.
```
The DFlash draft (7 GiB weights + dense-attention overhead) consumes the memory that KV needs, so
**200k is physically impossible with DFlash on this hardware — hard ceiling ~147k.** This is the
quantitative proof of "DFlash costs context" (Keys locked his at 128k for exactly this). Combined
with the 128k result (14% accept, slower than k5), DFlash is **doubly disqualified: it loses ~53k
of context AND runs slower** with a mismatched draft. A DFlash lane on our target would need (a) a
self-distilled draft matched to our weights AND (b) accepting ≤147k context — and even then it's a
count-only fast lane, not a k5 replacement.

## Phase C completed — FlashInfer 0.6.14 is ALREADY in the image; b12x owns attention.

- **Our serving image already ships `flashinfer-python==0.6.14`** (probed a throwaway container:
  "Requirement already satisfied ... 0.6.14", `flashinfer.mla` imports). The premise "bump
  0.6.13→0.6.14" is moot — we're already on the version jasl's #41834 credits.
- **But attention runs on our b12x `FLASHMLA_SPARSE` backend, not FlashInfer's sparse-MLA path.**
  Boot log: `Using FLASHMLA_SPARSE attention backend out of potential backends` (FlashInfer listed
  as *available*, not selected). So the 41.9/1757 numbers jasl got from FlashInfer's path are NOT
  automatically ours — realizing them means *switching the attention backend* to FlashInfer's
  sparse-MLA and revalidating against b12x, a real A/B, not a version bump.
- **k5 prefill baseline (measured this session):** ~596 tok/s @ 1.8k depth, ~1084 @ 7k, ~889 @ 32k.
  (Higher than the ~800 estimate; peaks mid-depth.)

### Revised Phase C verdict
The prefill lever is cheaper than thought (no rebuild — we have 0.6.14) but still not one-night:
it's a **backend-swap A/B** (FLASHMLA_SPARSE vs FlashInfer sparse-MLA) with real coherence/perf
revalidation risk on the serving path. Worth a dedicated session; documented, not swapped tonight
(guardrail: end serving ≥ KNOWNGOOD).

---

# Speed-Night 3 — FINAL

**Serving: k5 KNOWNGOOD** — MTP k=5, 200,064-token pool, `FLASHMLA_SPARSE`, coherent. **36 peak /
32.5 mean c1, 65–75 c6.** Unchanged, because **nothing beat it** — and that is now proven across
every lever, not assumed:

| Lever | Outcome |
|---|---|
| adaptive-k | regression (c1 ~22) |
| dual-rail RoCE | no-op (rail-2 link-local, NCCL ignored it) |
| local-argmax | slight regression (c1 28.9) |
| TTFT partial-prefill | pin-unsupported |
| cherry-pick #47448 | already in fork |
| cherry-pick #47410 | already effective (config fp32 router) |
| DFlash 128k (Keys' draft) | boots, 14% accept → slower everywhere |
| DFlash 200k | OOMs (max ctx ~147k) |
| FlashInfer 0.6.14 | already installed; b12x owns attention (backend-swap = future A/B) |

**Ranked remaining upside (all multi-day):**
1. **FlashInfer sparse-MLA backend swap** — cheapest real lever now that 0.6.14 is confirmed present; a backend A/B, not a rebuild. Prefill + decode candidate.
2. **Self-distilled DFlash draft vs our target** — the only path to a 40+ count fast-lane; needs training + ≤147k ctx; second endpoint, not a replacement.
3. **Re-pin to v0.25.1** — upstream GLM fixes; heavy revalidation.
4. **RDMA one-shot allreduce** — +5–10, weeks.

The honest headline: **k5 at 36 peak is the proven ceiling for one-night work on this stack.** Speed-Night 3 converted "untested ideas" into a measured map — every cheap lever is exhausted, and each big bet now has an exact, quantified requirement.

# Addendum — evaluating ciprianveg's v18 stack on 4 nodes (2026-07-25)

[ciprianveg/gb10-glm-5.2](https://github.com/ciprianveg/gb10-glm-5.2) publishes a v18 stack for
**8× GB10** (1,329 t/s prefill, 66 t/s peak decode) with prebuilt GHCR images. We tested
`ghcr.io/ciprianveg/gb10-glm-5.2:v18-prod` on our **4-node** cluster to see what transfers.

## What transfers, what doesn't

His image runs fine on 4 nodes: it accepts our native `mp` multi-node args
(`--nnodes/--node-rank/--master-addr/--headless`), TP=4, and our weights. Note its
`ENTRYPOINT` is `[vllm]`, so the container command starts at `serve …`, not `vllm serve …`.

**Measured, 4 nodes, fp8_ds_mla, gmu 0.91, abliterated weights (same shape as base):**

| | this recipe (v0.23.1 pin) | v18-prod |
|---|---|---|
| decode, warm | **32–33 t/s steady** | 36 t/s initially, **degrading to ~28** |
| KV pool | **200,064** | 142,263 (**−29%**) |
| max context @ gmu 0.91 | **200K** | ~140K |
| MTP mean acceptance | 2.75–4.75 | **4.85** |
| MTP draft acceptance rate | ~43–53% | **96.2%** |
| worker wedge under load | occurs | **still occurs** (`shm_broadcast` post-startup) |

**Conclusion: not worth adopting wholesale on 4 nodes.** His headline numbers are largely
node-count physics — prefill and aggregate concurrency scale with nodes; his *average* decode
(35 t/s, tg1500) is in the same band as ours. On 4 nodes his runtime (V2 runner + B12X indexer +
his graph config) reserves ~29% more memory, costing 60K of context, and it did not fix the
long-context worker wedge.

## The one finding worth stealing: MTP draft quantization mapping

The standout delta was **draft acceptance: ~43% → 96.2%**. His recipe passes an explicit
quantization for the MTP draft, ours does not:

```
# his
--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","quantization":"compressed-tensors",
  "draft_attention_backend":"B12X_MLA_SPARSE","num_speculative_tokens":4,
  "draft_tensor_parallel_size":1}'

# ours
--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":4,
  "draft_tensor_parallel_size":1,"attention_backend":"FLASHMLA_SPARSE"}'
```

paired with his `mods/fix-mtp-quant-packed-mapping` (packed_modules_mapping for
`fused_qkv_a_proj` + `gate_up_proj` in the MTP draft's quant config).

**Why this matters:** decode t/s ≈ mean_acceptance ÷ step_time. If the draft is being loaded
with a wrong/absent quant mapping, acceptance is depressed and every accepted token costs more
draft work. This is a **candidate one-line-plus-mod change to THIS recipe** — untested here as of
this writing, and the honest caveat is that our 43% baseline was measured on the abliterated
weights (whose draft is aligned to the non-abliterated distribution), so part of that gap may be
weight-specific rather than mapping-specific. **Needs an A/B on the base checkpoint before it goes
in the recipe.**

## Ops lesson (cost us two misdiagnoses)

After any crash/teardown, the workers' NFS mount of the weights share can drop. Symptom: workers
`Exited (1)` with `HFValidationError: Repo id must be in the form 'repo_name' or 'namespace/repo'`
(empty weights path), head hangs at `world_size=N rank=0 distributed_init`. We first read this as
a v18 compile/rendezvous failure — it was dying workers. **Always remount and verify the share on
every worker before relaunching:**

```bash
sudo umount /var/tmp/models 2>/dev/null
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3 <HEAD_FABRIC_IP>:/var/tmp/models /var/tmp/models
ls /var/tmp/models/hub/<weights-dir>/config.json   # must succeed on every worker
```
